🧩 Project Description: Encrypt & Decrypt Text App

This is a C# Windows Forms Application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a simple numeric key.
The program applies a custom character shifting algorithm, where each character in the text is shifted based on a secret key provided by the user.

It also replaces spaces with a unique symbol (¤) during encryption to ensure the text structure remains clear when decrypted.

The interface is divided into two sections — Encryption and Decryption — separated by a vertical line for a clean layout.
Validation messages guide the user to enter the required data before performing any operation.
